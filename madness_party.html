<h1>Fashion flared at WIFTV's Moulin Madness party</h1>

<img src="images/mm1.jpg" alt="The WIFTV Moulin Madness Organizers - Wendy D Photography"  width="584"/><p>The WIFTV Moulin Madness Organizers &#8211; Wendy D Photography</p>
<p>Fashion flared last night at Women in Film and Television Vancouver&#8217;s latest edition of Martini Madness- officially launching the Vancouver Film Festival&#8217;s industry conference with utter magnificence. The Vancouver Fan Club became Moulin Rouge for the night, and I&#8217;m sure they will be finding feathers and sparkles in random crevices for many years to come.</p>

<p><strong>Emcee Nicole Oliver ruled the night</strong></p>

<p>The Master of Ceremonies made a simple tap of her finger to her phone before the show. With that, her celebrity became quite evident. That one tweet of her outfit from <a href="http://laceembrace.com" target="_blank">Lace Embrace</a> generated a flutter of tweets by little pony avatars who rejoiced at the possibility of cosplay interpretations that this image may inspire.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='359' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/ohnuyqJyEW0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p>Yes, <i>Nicole Oliver</i> has quite a following, and they donned their fanciest pony hoodies on the red carpet for a chance to get an autograph from Princess Celestia.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='359' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/8fJSBoEUDs4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p>Far from a one trick pony, Nicole slid in and out of dozens of hilarious voices whenever they were applicable to her sharp wit. A master of the use of reverb, most effective of all was her commanding "mumma shush" that caused a wave of attention to wash over the crowd. Often breaking into spontaneous song throughout the night, her love of the stage was contagious as it beamed from every pore.</p>

<p><strong>The True Heroines &#8211; Femmes Fatales on stage</strong></p>
<img src="images/mm3.jpg" alt="The True Heroines on stage - from left: Paula Giroday, Jovanna Huguet, Fiona Vroom." width="584"/><p class="wp-caption-text">The True Heroines on stage &#8211; from left: Paula Giroday, Jovanna Huguet, Fiona Vroom.</p>
<p>The cabaret really heated up once <a href="http://thetrueheroines.com" target="_blank">The True Heroines</a> took to the stage with their sizzling performance skills and vibrant voices. Expertly choreographed and sinfully attired, the crowd didn&#8217;t know what hit them. This is especially true for the few attendees incorporated into the routine that were treated to the lap dance of their lives.</p>

<p>As far as performers go, these ladies are the real deal and they beautifully encapsulate a modern interpretation of what "woman" can mean- including a divine sense of humour.</p>
<p><strong>Chloë Angus&#8217; Best Dressed Competition</strong></p>
<img src="images/mm5.jpg" alt="MM5" width="300" height="280" />

<p>The cabaret was filled to the brim with dazzling renditions on the theme. <a href="http://www.chloeangus.com" target="_blank">Designer Chloë Angus</a> was tasked with choosing the Best Dressed winners. "This puts me in the very difficult category of choosing one man- not something I&#8217;m good at." She decided on "Phillip" because "everyone likes a gentleman." The best dressed woman was awarded to "Jennifer" because "those Fluevogs will get you in any door."</p>

<p>Obviously this was an event we will file away into our happy memory books. What a great way to celebrate WIFTV&#8217;s 25th anniversary year! Thanks to everyone who made it happen and especially to all of the beautiful people who showed up and sparkled into such a feast for the eyes.</p>
<p> <strong>Three new WIFTV &amp; Partners mentorships</strong></p>

<p>Three mentorships were announced this year with our partners: the Vancouver Film Festival, the Whistler Film Festival and William F White&#8217;s. Ed Brando announced that White&#8217;s Production Manager Mentorship is now accepting applications.</p>
<!--<p><strong>silent auction and super sponsors <img src="images/mm8.jpg" alt="MM8" width="199" height="299" /></strong></p>-->
<p>This year&#8217;s silent auction was wildly successful, raising big money for WIFTV programming thanks to a slew of very generous sponsors.</p>
<p>Hope to see you again, next year!</p>
